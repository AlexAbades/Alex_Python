PYTHON DEEP DIVE

With the goal of get a deeper knowladge of Python concepts, I started this course. One of the most interesting things I've done! 
He really understands the concepts behind the Python programming language, and also how to explin them.

I've made also my own scripts with a different IDE, PyCharm. I worked with the Jupyter enviroment, seeing what he has made, and making my own code in PyCharm.
The original files are the Jupyter files, and my the Pycharm files are the ones that I've made.

You also can find the original reporitory for those Jupyter files in his GitHub account:
