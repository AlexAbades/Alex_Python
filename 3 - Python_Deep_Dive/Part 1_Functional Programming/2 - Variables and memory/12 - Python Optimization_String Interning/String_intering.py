# Some strings are also automatically interned BUT NOT ALL!

# As Python code is compiled, identifiers are interned
# Variable names
# Function names
# Class names
# ...
# Identifiers should start with an underscore "_" or a letter. And can only contain letters, underscores and numbers

# Some strings may also be automatically interned.
# Strings literals that look like identifiers: 'hello_world'
# Although it starts with a digit, even thought that is not a valid identifier it may still get interned.

# ALL ABOUT OPTIMIZATION: SPEED AND MEMORY

# Python deals with a lot of dictionaries type lookups on string keys, ehich means a lot of equality testing.

a = 'some_long_string'
b = 'some_long_string'

# If we want to compare a == b --> we'll compare character by character
# If we know that 'some_long_string' has been interned then 'a' and 'b' are the same string if they both point to the
# same memory address.
# In which case we can use "a is b" instead. Which compares two integers (memory addresses)

# We can force strings to be interned by using the "sys.intern() method.

# Â¿ When we should use it ?
# Dealing with large number of string that could have high repetition: tokenizing a large corpus of text (NLP)
# Lots of string comparision
