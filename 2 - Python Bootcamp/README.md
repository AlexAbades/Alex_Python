2020 Complete Python Bootcamp From hero to Hero in Python

The first optional course I made to complement my knowladge. 
It's a good starter point if it has been a while since the last time you programmed in Python. 
You could find the original files of the course in:
https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp

I made all the course in a different IDE, PyCharm, and I went further in some concepts that the course explained.
You will find all my work in the above folders
